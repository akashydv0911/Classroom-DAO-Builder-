# Classroom DAO Builder â€“ Launch DAO in 1 Click

## ðŸ§© Project Title
**Classroom DAO Builder â€“ Launch DAO in 1 Click**

## ðŸ“œ Project Description
The **Classroom DAO Builder** is a lightweight Clarity-based smart contract that allows students or educators to launch their own decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) with a single transaction. Each participant can create a DAO under their own wallet address and retrieve their DAOâ€™s details easily.

This contract is designed for educational environments to give learners hands-on experience in DAO creation and on-chain identity.

## ðŸ”­ Project Vision
To empower students and educators to explore decentralized governance through a simple, minimalistic DAO builder that can be extended and customized. By abstracting away the complexities of full DAO protocols, this project helps users learn how Clarity smart contracts manage on-chain data and ownership.

## ðŸš€ Future Scope
- Add DAO governance features like proposal submission and voting.
- Allow funding through STX contributions.
- Enable DAO metadata updates and member management.
- Introduce NFT-based access control to join classroom DAOs.
